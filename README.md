# Quiznum_Adventure
I LOVE making games, even the design part - it is my favorite thing to do ever. Today I made a Number Guessing Game with Java and Android Studio. This game is called Quiznum Adventure (quiz + numbers + space, it's cool). There are three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), and you have 10 attempts to make guess the number, otherwise it's GAME OVER! ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾

Everything was designed by me, but the assets used are collected from Freepik. Please note that this game is not to be duplicated.
